# Video AI Summarizer Agent ðŸŽ¥ðŸŽ¤ðŸ–¬

## Overview
The **Video AI Summarizer Agent** is a multimodal AI-powered application designed to analyze video content and provide actionable insights. Leveraging Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp model and DuckDuckGo for web research, this tool allows users to upload video files, ask specific questions, and receive concise, user-friendly summaries and insights.

This project is built using **Streamlit** for the frontend interface and integrates advanced AI capabilities to process and analyze video content dynamically.
